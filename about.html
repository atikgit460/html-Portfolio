<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><i>Hello and welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Abdul Atik and I hail from Pandua, Hooghly. I am excited to tell you a little bit about myself and my professional journey so far.</i></p>
<br>
<p><i>I am a proud graduate of the University of Burdwan, where I earned my degree in Marketing. After completing my education, I joined Cogenthub Ltd, where I currently work as a Digital Marketer.</i></p>
<br>
<p><i><b>As a Digital Marketer, I have gained a wealth of knowledge and experience in various areas of online marketing, including social media marketing, email marketing, content marketing, and search engine optimization (SEO). My day-to-day responsibilities include managing digital campaigns, analyzing data and metrics, and developing creative strategies to optimize performance and drive growth.

    One of the things I love most about my job is the constant learning and adaptation required to keep up with the ever-evolving world of digital marketing. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and stay on top of industry trends and best practices.
    
    In my free time, I enjoy exploring new places, trying new foods, and spending time with family and friends. I also enjoy reading books and staying active through activities like hiking and yoga.
    
    Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me. I am excited to connect with you and explore potential opportunities to collaborate and grow together.</b></i></p>
